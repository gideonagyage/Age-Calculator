# Age Calculator in React JS

## Overview

This project is part of the Codevixens Frontend Development Challenge (Day 1). The goal is to build a simple yet functional age calculator using React JS, focusing on mastering state management and event handling.

## Features

- **State Management**: Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage the input value and calculated age.
- **Event Handling**: Handles user input and button click events to calculate the age.
- **Responsive UI**: Simple and user-friendly interface for entering birthdate and displaying the calculated age.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gideonagyage/age-calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd age-calculator
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

```bash

2. Open your browser and navigate to

```bash
http://localhost:3000.
```

## How It Works

1. Input Field: Enter your birthdate.
2. Submit Button: Click to calculate your age.
3. Age Display: The calculated age is displayed below the form.
